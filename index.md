# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  My first milestone is getting my servo motors to rotate in any way I want, getting sound to play, and getting the laser to light up. This is my first time doing anything with an arduino and breadboard so it was a challenge setting everything up. After wiring the servos, I wrote my own code using my previous coding experience to make the servos move. The laser and the buzzer where quite simple because I just needed to wire them up. I wrote a little but of code for the buzzer and got it to play anything I want.
